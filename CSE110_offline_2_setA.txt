Array input ( I used it using pointer)
Array toolkit (
  Printing that array along with its size,
  sorting, 
  avg of the int elements, 
  union of two arrays,
  Max repeatation of a particular number,
  Removing repeated elements thus an unique matrix;
  )
Matrix input or I should say matrix representation of an array given row and column number
Matrix operation (add, 
  subtract, 
  multiplication)
