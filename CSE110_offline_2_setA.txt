BUET EEE-22 assignment for 1-1
Array input - I used pointer method
Array Toolkit :- (
	print array
	check if sorted or not
	sort it
	unique array ie repeated elements should be wiped out 
	the element which has been repeated maximum times 
	Union of two arrays
	Avg of the array elements ( let's say we are only talking about integer arrays)

Matrix input or I should rather say the visual representation of an array given row and column number 
Matrix Toolkit :- (
	Add
	Subtraction
	Multiplication
Lexicographical problem is from another set. In that problem I was not allowed to use pointers or strings therefore I had to custom made strcpy and strcmp functions.
